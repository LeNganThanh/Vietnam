            Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is one of the most ancient cities in the world. This place offers examples of
            both contemporary and classical architecture right in the city center.
  
            A renowned destination for typical cuisine, home to fascinating attractions and hospitable people, and a
            diverse
            region with a combination of multi-communities. There is plenty to enjoy in Hanoi, from mouthwatering street
            food to fascinating history, from traditional entertainment to recreational activities.
  
            Even with a short amount of time, you can still feel the tranquilness of the city while sipping a cup of
            coffee.
            Wandering around and shooting artistic photos on elegant streets in the Old Quarter would give you unique
            experiences that are hardly found anywhere else.
  
            Outside the suburban areas, you can discover small charming villages which are homes to so many ethnic
            minorities. Hanoi joined
            UNESCO's Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on 31 October 2019, on the occasion of World Cities' Day.

          Ho Chi Minh City, commonly and formerly officially known as Saigon,
          is the largest city in Vietnam, situated in the south. In the
          southeastern region, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers
          about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Prior to
          Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely
          populated area that had been part of historic empires of Funan,
          Chenla, and Cambodia. With the arrival of Vietnamese, the area
          became more populated and officials began establishing the city from
          1623 to 1698. After it was ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to
          the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city
          underwent urbanization to become a financial center in the region.
          The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the
          Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the
          government of the unified Vietnam renamed Saigon in honor of Hồ Chí
          Minh.The primary economic center of Vietnam, it is also an emerging
          international destination.            Ho Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its
          history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and
          political groups. Originally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire
          known as Prey Nokor, it is still known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians
          today. In time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was
          officially renamed Gia Dinh (嘉定), a name that was retained until
          the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the
          name Sài Gòn, westernized as Saïgon, although the city was still
          indicated as 嘉定 on Vietnamese maps written in Chữ Hán until at
          least 1891.

          The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after
          reunification in 1976 to honor Ho Chi Minh.[nb 1] Even today,
          however, the informal name of Sài Gòn remains in daily speech.
          However, there is a technical difference between the two terms: Sài
          Gòn is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and
          the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers to all of its
          urban and rural districts.The current official name, Thành phố Hồ
          Chí Minh, first proclaimed in 1946, later adopted in 1976.             The earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the
          location of the current Phụng Sơn Buddhist temple, founded in the
          4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the
          site in the 11th century by the Champa. Baigaur was renamed Nokor
          around 1145, Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and
          area of forest. The first Vietnamese people crossed the sea to
          explore this land completely without the organization of the Nguyễn
          Lords. Thanks to the marriage between Princess Nguyễn Phúc Ngọc Vạn
          - daughter of Lord Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên - and the King of Cambodia
          Chettha II in 1620, the relationship between Vietnam and Cambodia
          became smooth, and the people of the two countries could freely move
          back and forth. Vietnamese settlers began to migrate to the area of
          Dong Nai. Before that the Funanese, Khmer, and Cham had lived there. Prior to Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a
          scarcely populated area that had been part of historic empires of
          Funan, Chenla, and Cambodia.

          In 2000, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee inscribed Hạ Long Bay in the World Heritage List according to its
          outstanding examples representing major stages of the Earth's history and its original limestone karstic
          geomorphologic features. Hạ Long Bay and its adjacent areas consist of a part of the Sino-Vietnamese composite
          terrane having its development history from pre-Cambrian up to present day.

          During Phanerozoic, terrigenous, volcanogenic and cherty-carbonate sediments containing in abundance
          graptolites,
          brachiopods, fishes, corals, foraminiferas, radiolarias, bivalves and flora, separated one from another by 10
          stratigraphic gaps, but the boundary between Devonian and Carboniferous has been considered as continuous. The
          limestone karstic geomorphology of the bay was developed since Miocene, especially the cone-shaped hills
          (fengcong), or isolated high limestone karst towers (fenglin) with many remnants of old phreatic caves, old
          karstic foot caves, marine notch caves form magnificent limestone karst landforms as unique on the world.
          The Quaternary geology was developed through 5 cycles with the intercalation of marine and continental
          environments.        </p>
